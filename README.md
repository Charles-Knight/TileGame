# TileGame

This is a popular tile based word building game implemented in java. It currently runs on the command line and it's future is uncertain. It may stay there or it may some day develop a GUI.

This is very much a work in progress.

Players draw tiles out of a collective tile pool and then take turns building words on the gameboard from the tiles they have. Players gain points based on the value of the characters in the words they build and the winner is the person who has the most points when all of the tiles have been exhausted or no other words can be created.
